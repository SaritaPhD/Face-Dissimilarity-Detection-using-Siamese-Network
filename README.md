# Face Dissimilarity Detection using Siamese Network

This project implements a Siamese neural network to detect dissimilarity between two face images using PyTorch and Streamlit for easy user interaction. The model is trained to differentiate between faces of different individuals.

## Project Structure

- `src/dataset.py`: Dataset class for loading and transforming image data.
- `src/network.py`: Defines the Siamese neural network and contrastive loss function.
- `src/train.py`: Script for training the model.
- `src/test.py`: Script for testing the model.
- `src/utils.py`: Helper functions for visualization.
- `app.py`: Streamlit app for making predictions.

## How to Run

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash

   streamlit run app.py
